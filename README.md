# hello-world
My First Repository
I hope to use GitHub to test out new software development technologies (languages, AI, big data, deep learning, GP GPU applications, etc.).  My day job is managing development efforts at a high level, but I rarely get to delve into coding itself.  Hopefully this will allow me to keep current with this fast-moving area!
